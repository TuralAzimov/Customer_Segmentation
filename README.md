# Customer_Segmentation
 In this project i worked on customer segmentation on an indian bank data. I tried different segmenation techniques  wtih different features and parts of this data. Algorithms that i used was K-nn and GMM. The data parts were RFM(recency,frequency,monetary) a behavioral targeting method, another one was selected features which contained fetures that had high variance.
